# Fallout-4-VR-F4FEVR-Redux
F4FEVR by ajantaju with a bunch of updates to old mods and Mantella's mod. Most of the credit for this
mod redux goes to ajantaju at https://github.com/ajantaju/F4FEVR/tree/main/Alternatives

I chose this mod mostly because it was one of the only mod packs that had operational Sim Settlements 2
Chapter 3 and beyond some eye candy, kept it mostly vanilla.  This mod pack has some of the original
mods updated to 2025 level where possible.  Some mods that involve Extended DIalogue Interface are not
100% EDI, as that file was meant for flat, not VR and recompiling that to work natively is more work
than I am willing to figure out.  The original mod has fixes for this, just keep in mind that xdi will
be flagged in Loot.  it can be ignored.

Additional mods include Koboldcpp, Mantella for voice interaction.  My configuration is for local, but
it can be easily chyanged to online AI generation, fees involved.  Contents of Kobold's folder also 
includes the voice and image files for very basic TTS/STT.  For detailed information, 
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/79747 is where it can be found.  
Two config files, kcpps and kcppt...are identical custom settings with exception that I renamed the
trailing s to a t on the first file after saving it as a preset within Kobold.  Documentation is
lacking on the interface and how to save a preset that autolaunches with the desired settings.  The
software has a button to make one, but it doesn't form it correctly and information that should be 
present, is not.  

Suffice to say, simply renaming the profile saved as kcpps to kcppt is sufficient enough 
as a single click start, achieves the same thing.  The configuration is optimized on a Ryzen 9 5950 
with 32GB RAM and a nVidea GeForce 5060TI with 16GB ram.  The auto start file is for when you want
the server to run and do its thing in the background.  The config file can be opened within Kobold
and edited accordingly to personal needs.  Benchmark test and compare results.  I used Chat GPT to 
analyze and compare results of various settings to settle on what is in the folder. Review Mantella's
documentation for more details on setup and use of the software.  The configuration files may not 
as is for everyone...unless they have a similar rig.  My esperience, it just closes if misconfigured.
Change settings and try again.  Save a template and reload, make adjustments and if they work in the
benchmark.  Unfortunately, the software requires restart after the test.  Reopen, select config to
load, adjust and resave.  Rinse and repeat as needed for your own rig.

I changed some mods for personal taste.  I changed the Another Pine Forest mod he used for "A Forest" 
mod...which I found visually nicer and it feels like a "forest" I am familiar with in RL.  Added a 
couple more guns into the mix, but I don't know if any of it works as yet.  Still developing it and 
working out the kinks...the biggest hurdle is to get Wabbajack to properly cooperate and figure out 
which software I need to strip to get it to "cooperate" at the end with loose files.

Until I do, this is the only stub to find on this page.  Apologies to anyone who stumbles on this
expecting a mod pack.
